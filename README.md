# Frontend Mentor - Notifications Page

![Design preview for the Notifications page coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Overview

Welcome to my solution for the Notifications Page challenge by Frontend Mentor. This project was a fantastic opportunity for me to hone my front-end development skills. I had to create a notifications page that closely resembled the provided design.

The challenge required me to build a responsive page with specific user interactions:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Implement a "Mark all as read" button to toggle the visual state of unread notifications and reset the count of unread messages to zero
- Ensure the layout is optimized for various screen sizes
- Implement hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## Where to Find Everything

To complete this project, I used the designs provided in the `/design` folder, which includes both mobile and desktop versions in JPG static format. This required me to use my judgment for styles like `font-size`, `padding`, and `margin`.

All the necessary assets for this project are located in the `/assets` folder. The images have been properly exported for the correct screen sizes and optimized. Additionally, variable and static font files for the required fonts are included. I chose to host the fonts locally for this project.

## Building Your Project

I followed a mobile-first workflow to create this responsive design. My process included:

1. Initiating the project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/) for easier collaboration and sharing.
2. Configuring my repository to publish my code to a web address, allowing me to easily share my project with others.
3. Carefully studying the design to plan how I would approach the project. This planning phase was essential for creating reusable CSS classes.
4. Structuring the content with HTML before adding any styles to ensure well-structured content.
5. Creating the base styles for the project, including defining the `font-family` and `font-size`.
6. Adding styles from top to bottom, moving to the next section only after completing the previous one.

## Deploying Your Project

For hosting this project, I used [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), a reliable and free hosting solution. This allowed me to easily share my live site URL.

## Sharing Your Solution

I shared my solution through various channels to receive feedback and showcase my work:

1. I posted my solution in the **#finished-projects** channel of the [Frontend Mentor Slack community](https://www.frontendmentor.io/slack).
2. I tweeted my solution to [@frontendmentor](https://twitter.com/frontendmentor), mentioning the repository and live URLs in the tweet.
3. I shared my solution on LinkedIn and other social media platforms.
4. I wrote a blog post about my experience building this project, discussing my workflow, technical choices, and code.

I encourage you to check out the live site to see the project in action.

## Acknowledgments

I'd like to thank Frontend Mentor for providing this challenging project. It allowed me to enhance my skills and apply my knowledge in a real-world scenario. Additionally, the supportive community on Slack provided valuable feedback and assistance throughout the process.

If you have any feedback or questions about my solution, please feel free to reach out to me. I'm open to learning and improving my skills further.

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
